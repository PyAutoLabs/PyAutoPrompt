- classification: library
- affected-repos:
  - PyAutoGalaxy
  - PyAutoLens
- notes: Initial implementation phase scoped to PyAutoGalaxy because PyAutoLens was claimed by datacube-shared-state. User confirmed this PyAutoLens follow-up does not clash with datacube work, so Codex continued on the canonical PyAutoLens branch.
