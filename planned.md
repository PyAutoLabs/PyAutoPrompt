- prompt: PyAutoPrompt/issued/jax_point_source_point_smoke_sentinel.md
- status: planned

- summary: |
    Pre-existing regression surfaced during fast-viz-zero-contour-perf smoke.
    `autolens_workspace_test/scripts/jax_likelihood_functions/point_source/point.py`
    fails its hardcoded `-83.38049778` literal — `fitness._vmap` returns the
    `-1e99` non-finite-likelihood sentinel from `FitPositionsImagePairAll` on
    canonical main of all three libraries. Last known good: 2026-05-08
    (autolens_workspace_test@362cfa8 rebaseline). Sibling JAX point-source
    profiling drift already tracked as PyAutoLens#514; this is a more severe
    symptom on a different file — held as two hypotheses (same root cause /
    independent regression) for triage.

    Affected repos (when resumed):
      - PyAutoLens (likely primary — PointSolver / FitPositionsImagePairAll)
      - PyAutoGalaxy or PyAutoArray (possible — bisect will say)
      - autolens_workspace_test (literal rebaseline OR no change, depending on outcome)

    Sibling smoke scripts to check while triaging: image_plane.py,
    source_plane.py in the same dir — they share the seed dataset.
