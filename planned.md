## jax-point-source-point-smoke-sentinel
- prompt: PyAutoPrompt/issued/jax_point_source_point_smoke_sentinel.md
- status: planned
- filed: 2026-05-21
- classification: library (triage; routing TBD by bisect)
- suggested-branch: feature/jax-point-source-point-smoke-sentinel
- summary: |
    Pre-existing regression surfaced during fast-viz-zero-contour-perf smoke.
    `autolens_workspace_test/scripts/jax_likelihood_functions/point_source/point.py`
    fails its hardcoded `-83.38049778` literal — `fitness._vmap` returns the
    `-1e99` non-finite-likelihood sentinel from `FitPositionsImagePairAll` on
    canonical main of all three libraries. Last known good: 2026-05-08
    (autolens_workspace_test@362cfa8 rebaseline). Sibling JAX point-source
    profiling drift already tracked as PyAutoLens#514; this is a more severe
    symptom on a different file — held as two hypotheses (same root cause /
    independent regression) for triage.

    Affected repos (when resumed):
      - PyAutoLens (likely primary — PointSolver / FitPositionsImagePairAll)
      - PyAutoGalaxy or PyAutoArray (possible — bisect will say)
      - autolens_workspace_test (literal rebaseline OR no change, depending on outcome)

    Sibling smoke scripts to check while triaging: image_plane.py,
    source_plane.py in the same dir — they share the seed dataset.

## nfw-truncated-potential-accuracy
- prompt: PyAutoPrompt/autogalaxy/nfw_truncated_potential_accuracy.md
- status: planned
- filed: 2026-06-05
- classification: library (accuracy bug)
- suggested-branch: feature/nfw-truncated-potential-accuracy
- summary: |
    Pre-existing accuracy bug surfaced while shipping dark-matter-potentials.
    NFWTruncatedSph.potential_2d_from (MGE) fails grad(psi)=alpha self-
    consistency in autolens_workspace_test/scripts/mass/dark.py (med 7.1e-2 vs
    ~8e-4 for every other NFW/gNFW/cNFW variant). Deflections pass, only the
    potential is off — likely the MGE sigma range (radii_max = truncation_radius
    * 5) is too narrow. Reproduce on clean main first.

## piemass-potential
- prompt: PyAutoPrompt/autogalaxy/piemass_potential.md
- status: planned
- filed: 2026-06-05
- classification: library (missing feature)
- suggested-branch: feature/piemass-potential
- summary: |
    PIEMass (Lenstool-ported PIE) has no potential_2d_from, so it now raises a
    clean NotImplementedError (post dark-matter-potentials) and crashes tracer
    visualization (potential FITS extension) — same class as the original NFW
    bug, different profile. No MGE/CSE decomposition hook exists; needs an
    analytic port (Kassiola & Kovner 1993, or the dPIEMass r_s->inf limit) or a
    new convergence-MGE hook. Validate via grad(psi)=alpha self-consistency.
